# Skill: Positioning Angles

## Purpose
Generate 3-5 differentiation angles using psychology-driven frameworks. Move beyond feature-based positioning to find the hook that makes a brand impossible to ignore.

## When This Activates
After Brand Voice is defined, when launching a new product/service, when current positioning feels generic, or when entering a crowded market.

## Inputs Required
- Brand Voice profile
- Market research (competitors, gaps, audience language)
- Product/service description and key transformation
- Target audience (who they are, what they want, what they fear)

## The 8 Positioning Frameworks

### 1. The Overlooked Champion
**Psychology:** People trust underdogs. They distrust market leaders.
**Pattern:** "While everyone obsesses over [popular thing], [your approach] quietly delivers [outcome]."
**Best for:** Products competing against well-known alternatives.

### 2. The Compound Engine
**Psychology:** Delayed gratification signals credibility.
**Pattern:** "Day 1 looks like nothing. Day 90 looks like luck. Day 365 looks like magic."
**Best for:** Services/products with compounding results (SEO, investing, habits).

### 3. The Speed Advantage
**Psychology:** Time is the scarcest resource. Speed implies competence.
**Pattern:** "[Outcome] in [timeframe], not [expected longer timeframe]."
**Best for:** Tools, SaaS, done-for-you services.

### 4. The Anti-Guru
**Psychology:** Market fatigue with influencer culture creates demand for authenticity.
**Pattern:** "Not another [category] bro. Just [honest value proposition]."
**Best for:** Info products, courses, coaching in saturated markets.

### 5. The Specialist
**Psychology:** Specialists command premium prices and higher trust.
**Pattern:** "We only work with [specific niche]. That's why we [specific result]."
**Best for:** Consulting, agencies, professional services.

### 6. The Founder Story
**Psychology:** Origin stories create emotional connection and trust.
**Pattern:** "I built this because [personal frustration]. Now [transformation for others]."
**Best for:** E-commerce, DTC brands, personal brands.

### 7. The Simplicity Angle
**Psychology:** Complexity fatigue in over-engineered markets.
**Pattern:** "The [category] that just works. No [pain point]. No [pain point]."
**Best for:** SaaS, tools, apps replacing complex alternatives.

### 8. The Methodology Transfer
**Psychology:** Proven systems feel safer than generic advice.
**Pattern:** "What took me [years/effort] to figure out, packaged into [deliverable]."
**Best for:** Courses, frameworks, info products.

## Process

### Step 1: Market Context
Using research, identify:
- What positioning do competitors use? (map them to the 8 frameworks)
- Where are the gaps? (which frameworks are underused?)
- What does the audience distrust? (avoid those patterns)

### Step 2: Generate 3-5 Angles
For each angle, provide:
```markdown
## Angle [N]: [Framework Name]

**Core Hook:** [One sentence that captures the angle]
**Psychology:** Why this works for this specific audience
**Headline Directions:**
- Headline option 1
- Headline option 2
- Headline option 3
**Anti-Angle:** What this angle rejects (the opposite positioning)
**Risk:** What could go wrong with this angle
```

### Step 3: Evaluate Angles
Score each angle against:
- [ ] **Differentiation:** Does this separate us from competitors?
- [ ] **Authenticity:** Can the brand actually deliver on this promise?
- [ ] **Resonance:** Does the target audience care about this?
- [ ] **Longevity:** Will this still work in 12 months?
- [ ] **Specificity:** Is this impossible to copy without being us?

### Step 4: Recommend Top Pick
Present all 3-5 angles, then recommend 1-2 with reasoning. The human makes the final call.

## Business Type Quick Reference

| Business Type | Top Frameworks | Avoid |
|---------------|---------------|-------|
| Info/Education | Anti-Guru, Methodology Transfer, Compound Engine | Speed (feels scammy) |
| Consulting/Agency | Specialist, Methodology Transfer, Anti-Guru | Founder Story (too personal) |
| E-commerce | Founder Story, Simplicity, Overlooked Champion | Specialist (too narrow) |
| SaaS | Simplicity, Speed, Overlooked Champion | Anti-Guru (wrong context) |

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Each angle has a clear psychological basis (not just "sounds good")
- [ ] Headline directions are specific, not generic
- [ ] At least one angle is contrarian or unexpected
- [ ] Anti-angle is defined for each (what it rejects)
- [ ] Human selects the winner, not AI
