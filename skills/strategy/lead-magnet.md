# Skill: Lead Magnet

## Purpose
Develop high-converting opt-in concepts that bridge awareness to paid offerings. Create lead magnets that demonstrate expertise, solve an immediate problem, and naturally lead to the core offer.

## When This Activates
When building a Conversion Stack, when a client needs to grow their email list, or when there's no bridge between content and sales.

## Inputs Required
- Target audience pain points (from research)
- Core product/service offering
- Positioning angles (from Positioning skill)
- Brand voice profile
- Conversion goal (what should happen after they opt in?)

## Lead Magnet Frameworks

### Framework 1: The Quick Win
**Pattern:** Solve one specific problem immediately.
**Format:** Checklist, template, calculator, swipe file
**Best for:** Busy professionals who want instant results
**Example:** "The 15-Minute SEO Audit Checklist"

### Framework 2: The Roadmap
**Pattern:** Show the path from current state to desired state.
**Format:** PDF guide, mini-course, email series
**Best for:** People who know they need help but don't know where to start
**Example:** "From Zero to 10K Monthly Visitors: The 90-Day Content Roadmap"

### Framework 3: The Toolkit
**Pattern:** Bundle the tools/resources needed for a specific task.
**Format:** Resource list, template pack, starter kit
**Best for:** DIY-minded audience who wants to do it themselves (for now)
**Example:** "The Complete Email Marketing Starter Kit (templates + sequences)"

### Framework 4: The Case Study
**Pattern:** Show proof of the transformation your offer delivers.
**Format:** PDF, video walkthrough, interactive breakdown
**Best for:** Skeptical audiences who need evidence before committing
**Example:** "How [Client] went from $5K to $50K/mo in 6 months (full breakdown)"

### Framework 5: The Assessment
**Pattern:** Help them diagnose their current situation.
**Format:** Quiz, scorecard, audit tool
**Best for:** Audiences who don't know their real problem yet
**Example:** "The Marketing Health Score: Grade your strategy in 5 minutes"

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Bridge
Map the journey:
```
[Awareness content] → [LEAD MAGNET] → [Core offer]

The lead magnet must:
- Solve a problem related to (but not identical to) your core offer
- Demonstrate your methodology/expertise
- Create a natural "what's next?" moment
```

### Step 2: Select Framework
Based on audience and offer, pick 1-2 frameworks. Consider:
- What does the audience value most? (speed, proof, tools, clarity)
- What format matches their consumption habits?
- What naturally bridges to your paid offering?

### Step 3: Define the Concept
```markdown
## Lead Magnet Concept

**Title:** [Specific, benefit-driven title]
**Framework:** [Which framework]
**Format:** [PDF / Video / Quiz / Template / etc.]
**Core Promise:** [One sentence: what they get]
**Time to Consume:** [5 min / 15 min / 30 min]
**Bridge to Offer:** [How this leads to the paid product/service]

**Content Outline:**
1. [Section 1]
2. [Section 2]
3. [Section 3]
4. [CTA: Next step toward core offer]
```

### Step 4: Write the Opt-In Copy
Using Brand Voice and Positioning Angles, write:
- **Headline:** [Benefit-driven, specific]
- **Subheadline:** [What they get + how fast]
- **3 Bullet Points:** [Key takeaways / what's inside]
- **CTA Button:** [Action-oriented, specific]
- **Social Proof:** [If available]

### Step 5: Define the Delivery Sequence
What happens after they opt in:
```
1. Instant delivery (email + download page)
2. Welcome email (introduce yourself, set expectations)
3. Follow-up email 1 (check if they used it, offer help)
4. Follow-up email 2 (bridge to core offer)
→ Flows into Email Sequences skill
```
