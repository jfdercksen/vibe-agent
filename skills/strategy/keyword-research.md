# Skill: Keyword Research (6 Circles Method)

## Purpose
Identify SEO opportunities that competitors miss using comparative gap analysis. Produce a prioritized keyword strategy with quick-win targets for 60-90 day results.

## When This Activates
When building a Traffic Stack, when starting SEO for a new client, or when existing content isn't ranking.

## Inputs Required
- Business type and niche
- Target audience description
- 3-5 competitor websites
- Current website (if exists)
- Existing content inventory

## The 6 Circles Method

The 6 Circles represent overlapping keyword territories. Opportunities live in the gaps.

```
Circle 1: Your existing rankings (what you already rank for)
Circle 2: Competitor A rankings
Circle 3: Competitor B rankings
Circle 4: Competitor C rankings
Circle 5: Audience questions (forums, Reddit, Quora, social)
Circle 6: Adjacent topics (related industries, upstream/downstream)
```

**The sweet spots:**
- Keywords in Circles 2-4 but NOT Circle 1 (competitor gaps)
- Keywords in Circle 5 but NOT Circles 2-4 (unserved audience questions)
- Keywords in Circle 6 that no one targets (blue ocean)

## Process

### Step 1: Gather Data (Use Perplexity MCP)
Research the following for each competitor:
- What topics do they rank for?
- What content formats do they use? (blogs, tools, guides)
- What questions does the audience ask that no one answers well?
- What adjacent topics connect to the core niche?

### Step 2: Map the Circles
Create a keyword map organized by:

```markdown
## Keyword Map: [Client Name]

### High-Priority Gaps (Competitors rank, we don't)
| Keyword | Search Intent | Competitor | Difficulty | Priority |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|----------|
| [keyword] | [informational/transactional/navigational] | [who ranks] | [low/med/high] | [1-5] |

### Unserved Questions (Audience asks, no one answers well)
| Question | Source | Current Best Answer Quality | Opportunity |
|----------|--------|---------------------------|-------------|

### Blue Ocean (Adjacent, no one targets)
| Topic | Connection to Core Business | Potential |
|-------|---------------------------|-----------|
```

### Step 3: Prioritize for Quick Wins (60-90 days)
Quick wins have ALL of these:
- [ ] Low-medium difficulty
- [ ] Clear search intent match to your offering
- [ ] No authoritative competitor dominates the SERP
- [ ] Can be addressed with a single content piece
- [ ] Aligns with a positioning angle

### Step 4: Build Content Pillars
Group keywords into 3-5 content pillars:
```markdown
## Pillar: [Topic Cluster Name]
**Core page:** [Main keyword / hub page]
**Supporting content:**
- [Supporting keyword 1] → [content format]
- [Supporting keyword 2] → [content format]
- [Supporting keyword 3] → [content format]
**Internal linking strategy:** [How pieces connect]
```

### Step 5: Create Publication Calendar
```markdown
## 60-90 Day Content Plan
### Month 1: [Quick wins - low difficulty, high intent]
- Week 1-2: [Content piece 1]
- Week 3-4: [Content piece 2]

### Month 2: [Build authority - medium difficulty]
- Week 1-2: [Content piece 3]
- Week 3-4: [Content piece 4]

### Month 3: [Expand - pillar pages + supporting content]
- Week 1-2: [Content piece 5]
- Week 3-4: [Content piece 6]
```

## Key Rules
- Quality over quantity. One excellent piece beats five mediocre ones.
- Human fact-checking required before publishing any SEO content.
- Phased publication. Never dump all content simultaneously.
- Every piece must answer a real question the audience has.
- Match search intent precisely (informational ≠ transactional).

## Quality Gates
- [ ] At least 3 competitors analyzed
- [ ] Gap analysis identifies opportunities competitors miss
- [ ] Quick wins are genuinely achievable in 60-90 days
- [ ] Content pillars align with positioning angles
- [ ] Publication calendar is realistic (not 50 posts in month 1)
