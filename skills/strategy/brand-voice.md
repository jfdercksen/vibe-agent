# Skill: Brand Voice

## Purpose
Extract and define a brand's authentic personality, tone, and vocabulary from existing content and values. Produces a reusable voice profile document that guides all future copy and creative work.

## When This Activates
When starting with a new client, when brand messaging feels inconsistent, or when the user asks for voice/tone definition.

## Inputs Required
- Existing brand content (website copy, social posts, emails, ads)
- Company values and mission statement
- Target audience description
- Competitor examples (what you're NOT)
- Any existing brand guidelines

## Process

### Step 1: Content Audit
Analyze all available brand materials. Look for:
- Recurring phrases and language patterns
- Tone shifts between channels (formal on web, casual on social?)
- Unique expressions the brand already uses naturally
- Sentences that "sound like them" vs. generic filler

### Step 2: Extract Voice Dimensions
Define the brand across these spectrums:

| Dimension | Scale |
|-----------|-------|
| Formal ↔ Casual | Where on the spectrum? |
| Serious ↔ Playful | How much humor? |
| Technical ↔ Accessible | Jargon level? |
| Reserved ↔ Enthusiastic | Energy level? |
| Traditional ↔ Rebellious | How much convention-breaking? |

### Step 3: Define Personality Traits
Select 3-5 core personality traits. Examples:
- Direct (says it plainly, no corporate fluff)
- Knowledgeable (shows expertise without showing off)
- Encouraging (empowers without patronizing)
- Honest (admits limitations, avoids hype)

### Step 4: Build Vocabulary Guide

**Words & Phrases to EMBRACE:**
- Words that feel authentic to this brand
- Industry terms the audience actually uses
- Action words that match the brand energy
- Example: "boring," "compound," "actually works," "practitioners"

**Words & Phrases to AVOID:**
- Generic AI-sounding language
- Overused marketing buzzwords
- Words that contradict the brand personality
- Example: "revolutionary," "leverage," "optimize," "synergy," "game-changing"

### Step 5: Anti-Positioning
Define what the brand is NOT:
- "We are NOT the guru selling dreams"
- "We are NOT the corporate agency with 47 approval layers"
- "We do NOT use hype language or manufactured urgency"

### Step 6: Channel Adaptation
Specify voice adjustments per channel:
- **Website:** [slight adjustments]
- **Email:** [slight adjustments]
- **Social:** [slight adjustments]
- **Ads:** [slight adjustments]
