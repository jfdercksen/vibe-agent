# Skill: Direct Response Copy

## Purpose
Create landing pages and sales copy using 100+ years of proven copywriting methodology. Produce copy that sounds human, drives conversions, and is free of AI artifacts.

## When This Activates
When building landing pages, sales pages, product pages, or any conversion-focused copy. Part of the Conversion Stack.

## Inputs Required
- Positioning angle (from Positioning Angles skill)
- Brand voice profile (from Brand Voice skill)
- Target audience research (pain points, desires, language)
- Product/service details and transformation offered
- Conversion goal (buy, book a call, sign up, download)

## Core Methodologies Encoded

### Eugene Schwartz: 5 Levels of Market Sophistication
1. **Unaware:** Audience doesn't know they have a problem → Lead with the problem
2. **Problem Aware:** Knows the problem, not the solution → Agitate the pain
3. **Solution Aware:** Knows solutions exist, not yours → Differentiate your approach
4. **Product Aware:** Knows your product, hasn't bought → Overcome objections
5. **Most Aware:** Ready to buy → Make the offer irresistible

**Rule:** Identify the audience's awareness level FIRST. This determines the entire page structure.

### Claude Hopkins: Scientific Advertising Principles
- Specificity beats generality ("37% increase" > "dramatic improvement")
- One clear proposition per page
- Test headlines relentlessly
- Copy is salesmanship in print

### David Ogilvy: Research-Driven Copy
- The headline is 80% of the ad
- Long copy sells (when it's interesting)
- Facts persuade more than adjectives
- Never write copy you wouldn't want your family to read

### Gary Halbert: The A-Pile Principle
- Write like a letter from a friend, not a corporation
- Use the reader's own language (from research)
- The offer matters more than the copy
- Urgency must be real, not manufactured

## Process

### Step 1: Define the Page Architecture
Based on awareness level, select structure:

**For Problem/Solution Aware (most common):**
```
1. Hero Section (headline + subheadline + CTA)
2. Problem Agitation (their current pain)
3. Solution Introduction (your approach)
4. How It Works (3-step process)
5. Benefits (transformation, not features)
6. Social Proof (testimonials, results, logos)
7. Objection Handling (FAQ or myth-busting)
8. Final CTA (with urgency if genuine)
```

**For Most Aware (retargeting, warm traffic):**
```
1. Hero with offer front-and-center
2. Quick reminder of value
3. Social proof
4. CTA with bonus/incentive
```

### Step 2: Write the Hero Section
Generate 5-10 headline options. Each must:
- [ ] Lead with the transformation, not the product
- [ ] Use specific language from audience research
- [ ] Pass the "would I stop scrolling?" test
- [ ] Match the positioning angle

Present ALL options. Human picks the winner.

**Subheadline formula:** [Who it's for] + [what they get] + [without what they fear]

### Step 3: Write Each Section
For every section:
- Use the brand voice vocabulary guide
- Write at the reading level of the audience
- One idea per paragraph
- Short sentences. Punchy rhythm. Then a longer one to let the reader breathe.
- Remove every word that doesn't earn its place

### Step 4: CTA Optimization
CTA button text should:
- Use first person ("Start My Free Trial" not "Start Your Free Trial")
- Be action-specific ("Get the Roadmap" not "Submit")
- Reduce risk ("Start Free" not "Buy Now" for first conversion)

Add micro-copy below the CTA:
- "No credit card required"
- "Join 2,400+ marketers"
- "Cancel anytime"

### Step 5: Voice Enforcement Pass
Read the entire page and flag:
- [ ] Any word from the "Avoid" vocabulary list
- [ ] Sentences that sound like every other website
- [ ] Claims without specificity
- [ ] AI artifacts ("In today's fast-paced world...", "Whether you're a...")
- [ ] Passive voice (replace with active)

## AI Artifact Removal Checklist
Remove or rewrite any instance of:
- "In today's [adjective] world"
- "Whether you're a [x] or [y]"
- "Look no further"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Take your [x] to the next level"
- "Seamless" / "Seamlessly"
- "Revolutionize" / "Revolutionary"
- "Cutting-edge" / "State-of-the-art"
- Any sentence that could appear on 1,000 other websites

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Awareness level identified and structure matches
- [ ] 5+ headline options generated (human selects)
- [ ] Brand voice vocabulary enforced throughout
- [ ] Zero AI artifact phrases remain
- [ ] Every claim has specificity (numbers, timeframes, results)
- [ ] CTA is action-specific with risk-reducing micro-copy
- [ ] Page reads like a human wrote it, not a committee
