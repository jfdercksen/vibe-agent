# Skill: Newsletter

## Purpose
Create engagement-focused email content using 9 distinct formats. Build newsletters that people actually open, read, and share — not just another unread email.

## When This Activates
When building recurring email content, part of the Nurture Stack, or when a client needs to maintain audience engagement between launches.

## Inputs Required
- Brand voice profile
- Content pillars / topic areas
- Audience interests and pain points
- Send frequency (weekly, biweekly, monthly)
- Newsletter goal (engagement, traffic, nurture, sales support)

## The 9 Newsletter Formats

### 1. The Curator
**Pattern:** Curate the best resources on a topic so the reader doesn't have to.
**Structure:** 3-5 links with your commentary on why each matters.
**Best for:** Industry-focused audiences who value staying current.
**Example:** "5 things I read this week on [topic] (and what they mean for you)"

### 2. The Teacher
**Pattern:** One actionable lesson per issue.
**Structure:** Problem → Concept → Step-by-step → Result.
**Best for:** Skill-building audiences.
**Example:** "How to [specific tactic] in [timeframe] (step by step)"

### 3. The Storyteller
**Pattern:** Share a narrative that delivers a lesson or insight.
**Structure:** Hook → Story → Lesson → Application.
**Best for:** Personal brands, coaches, consultants.
**Example:** "I lost $10K last month. Here's what it taught me about [topic]."

### 4. The Analyst
**Pattern:** Break down data, trends, or case studies with your interpretation.
**Structure:** Data/observation → Analysis → What it means for the reader.
**Best for:** Data-savvy, B2B audiences.
**Example:** "[Industry] trend report: what the numbers actually say"

### 5. The Contrarian
**Pattern:** Challenge conventional wisdom in your space.
**Structure:** Popular belief → Why it's wrong → Better approach.
**Best for:** Thought leadership, standing out in crowded markets.
**Example:** "Unpopular opinion: [common practice] is hurting your [metric]"

### 6. The Behind-the-Scenes
**Pattern:** Show the real process behind your work.
**Structure:** What we did → What went wrong → What we learned → The result.
**Best for:** Building trust and relatability.
**Example:** "How we built [thing]: the messy truth"

### 7. The Q&A
**Pattern:** Answer real questions from your audience.
**Structure:** Question → Context → Answer → Action step.
**Best for:** Community-driven brands with active audiences.
**Example:** "You asked, I answered: [3 reader questions]"

### 8. The Roundup
**Pattern:** Compile insights from multiple experts or sources.
**Structure:** Theme → Expert/source 1 → Expert/source 2 → Your synthesis.
**Best for:** Network builders, community-focused brands.
**Example:** "I asked 10 [role] about [topic]. Here's what they said."

### 9. The Framework
**Pattern:** Share a mental model or decision-making tool.
**Structure:** Problem → Framework → How to use it → Examples.
**Best for:** Strategic, senior audiences.
**Example:** "The [name] framework: How I decide [common decision]"

## Process

### Step 1: Build a Format Calendar
Don't use the same format every week. Rotate for variety:
```
Week 1: Teacher (actionable how-to)
Week 2: Storyteller (narrative + lesson)
Week 3: Curator (best resources)
Week 4: Contrarian (challenge assumptions)
```

### Step 2: Write the Issue
For every newsletter:
- **Subject line:** Specific, curiosity-driven, 6-10 words
- **Opening hook:** First 2 sentences determine if they read or skim
- **Body:** Follow the structure of the chosen format
- **CTA:** One clear next step (reply, read more, try this)
- **PS:** Optional bonus tip, personal note, or teaser for next issue

### Step 3: Voice Check
- [ ] Sounds like the brand, not like generic content
- [ ] Opening hook earns the next sentence
- [ ] No AI artifact phrases
- [ ] One idea, one CTA
- [ ] Would you forward this to a friend?

## Newsletter Metrics to Track
- Open rate (subject line effectiveness)
- Click rate (content relevance)
- Reply rate (engagement depth)
- Unsubscribe rate (audience fit)
- Forward/share rate (content quality signal)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Format is deliberately chosen (not default to "Teacher" every time)
- [ ] Subject line is specific and tested (A/B if possible)
- [ ] Opening hook is strong enough to earn 30 seconds of attention
- [ ] Brand voice is consistent
- [ ] One clear CTA per issue
- [ ] Content is genuinely useful (passes "would I read this?" test)
