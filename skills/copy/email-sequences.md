# Skill: Email Sequences

## Purpose
Design automated email flows that welcome, nurture, and convert subscribers. Build sequences that feel personal, deliver real value, and naturally bridge to the core offer.

## When This Activates
After a lead magnet is created, when setting up email automation, or when building the Nurture Stack.

## Inputs Required
- Trigger event (lead magnet download, signup, purchase, etc.)
- Brand voice profile
- Positioning angle
- Core offer / conversion goal
- Audience pain points and desires

## The 7-Email Welcome Sequence Framework

### DELIVER → CONNECT → VALUE → VALUE → BRIDGE → SOFT → DIRECT

```
Email 1: DELIVER (Day 0 — Immediate)
Email 2: CONNECT (Day 1)
Email 3: VALUE (Day 3)
Email 4: VALUE (Day 5)
Email 5: BRIDGE (Day 7)
Email 6: SOFT (Day 9)
Email 7: DIRECT (Day 11)
```

### Email 1: DELIVER
**Goal:** Deliver the lead magnet + make a great first impression.
**Structure:**
- Subject: Deliver on the promise (e.g., "Your [Lead Magnet] is ready")
- Quick intro (1-2 sentences about who you are)
- Download/access link (prominent)
- One tip on how to get the most from it
- Set expectations for what's coming next
- PS: One surprising fact or quick win

**Tone:** Warm, direct, no fluff. They just gave you their email — respect it.

### Email 2: CONNECT
**Goal:** Build a personal connection. Show there's a real human here.
**Structure:**
- Subject: Something personal, not salesy
- Share your origin story briefly (why you do this)
- Connect your story to their situation
- Ask a question (reply to this email: what's your biggest challenge with [topic]?)
- No selling

**Tone:** Conversational. Like a message from a colleague, not a brand.

### Email 3: VALUE
**Goal:** Teach something useful. Demonstrate expertise.
**Structure:**
- Subject: A specific result or insight
- One actionable tip they can implement today
- Brief context for why this matters
- Show the result this produces
- Link to related content (blog, video) if available

**Tone:** Helpful teacher. Give real value, not teasers.

### Email 4: VALUE
**Goal:** Address a common mistake or misconception.
**Structure:**
- Subject: The mistake/myth angle
- Identify the common mistake the audience makes
- Explain why it happens (empathy, not judgment)
- Share the correct approach
- Quick case study or example if available

**Tone:** Empathetic expert. "I used to make this mistake too."

### Email 5: BRIDGE
**Goal:** Transition from free value to the concept behind your offer.
**Structure:**
- Subject: The transformation angle
- Recap the value provided so far
- Introduce the bigger problem (the one your product/service solves)
- Paint the picture: current state vs. desired state
- Mention your approach (not the product yet — the methodology)

**Tone:** Guide. You're pointing to the destination.

### Email 6: SOFT
**Goal:** Introduce the offer gently with social proof.
**Structure:**
- Subject: Result or testimonial driven
- Share a customer story or case study
- Describe the transformation (before → after)
- Mention your offer naturally as part of the story
- Soft CTA: "If you're curious, here's more about [offer]"

**Tone:** Storyteller. Let the results do the selling.

### Email 7: DIRECT
**Goal:** Make the clear offer with a reason to act.
**Structure:**
- Subject: Direct and clear (e.g., "Is [offer] right for you?")
- Acknowledge they've been getting value from you
- Present the offer clearly (what they get, what it costs, what the result is)
- Handle the top 2-3 objections
- Clear CTA with genuine reason to act now
- PS: Reminder of the core transformation

**Tone:** Confident and direct. No hard sell, but no apologizing for selling either.

## Additional Sequence Templates

### Post-Purchase Nurture (5 emails)
```
1. WELCOME: Onboarding + quick start guide
2. CHECK-IN: How's it going? Need help?
3. DEEPEN: Advanced tip or hidden feature
4. SOCIAL: Invite to community / share their experience
5. EXPAND: Related product/service or referral ask
```

### Re-engagement (3 emails)
```
1. "We miss you" (value-first, not guilt)
2. Best content roundup (your top hits)
3. Last chance + survey (why did they go quiet?)
```

## Writing Rules for All Emails
- Subject lines: 6-10 words, specific, curiosity-driven
- Preview text: Adds context, doesn't repeat subject
- One idea per email. One CTA per email.
- Write at 8th grade reading level
- Short paragraphs (1-3 sentences)
- Use the reader's language from research
- Enforce brand voice vocabulary (embrace/avoid lists)
- No AI artifacts (see Direct Response Copy skill)

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Sequence has a clear emotional arc (deliver → connect → value → sell)
- [ ] Each email has ONE job and ONE CTA
- [ ] Subject lines are specific and curiosity-driven
- [ ] Brand voice is consistent across all emails
- [ ] The bridge from free to paid feels natural, not jarring
