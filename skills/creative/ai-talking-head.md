# Skill: AI Talking Head

## Purpose
Produce UGC-style presenter videos with AI-generated lip-sync capability. Scale video testimonials, explainers, and social content without filming.

## When This Activates
When creating social proof videos, UGC-style ad content, or talking-head explainer content. Useful for clients who need video presence but lack filming capability.

## Inputs Required
- Script (from Direct Response Copy or Email Sequences skills)
- Presenter style direction (professional, casual, energetic, authoritative)
- Brand voice profile
- Platform and duration requirements
- Visual context (product/service being discussed)

## Video Styles

### Testimonial
**Purpose:** Social proof from a "customer" perspective.
**Tone:** Authentic, conversational, relatable
**Structure:** Problem → Discovery → Experience → Result → Recommendation
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds

### Expert Explainer
**Purpose:** Establish authority on a topic.
**Tone:** Knowledgeable, approachable
**Structure:** Question → Context → Answer → Action step
**Duration:** 60-90 seconds

### Product Demo
**Purpose:** Walk through product features/benefits.
**Tone:** Enthusiastic but not pushy
**Structure:** Introduction → Feature 1 → Feature 2 → Benefit summary → CTA
**Duration:** 30-90 seconds

### Story-Based
**Purpose:** Emotional connection through narrative.
**Tone:** Personal, relatable
**Structure:** Hook → Situation → Conflict → Resolution → Lesson
**Duration:** 60-120 seconds

## Process

### Step 1: Write the Script
Follow these rules for talking-head scripts:
- Write for the ear, not the eye (read aloud while writing)
- Use contractions ("I'm" not "I am", "it's" not "it is")
- Short sentences. Natural pauses.
- One idea per breath
- Include verbal transitions ("So here's the thing...", "And that's when...")
- Avoid jargon unless the audience uses it daily

```markdown
## Script: [Video Name]

**Duration:** [X seconds]
**Style:** [Testimonial / Expert / Demo / Story]
**Tone:** [2-3 adjectives]

---

[HOOK - First 3 seconds]
"[Opening line that stops the scroll]"

[BODY]
"[Main content, broken into natural speaking segments]"

[CTA]
"[Clear next step]"

---

**Delivery Notes:**
- Pace: [Fast/medium/slow]
- Energy: [High/medium/low]
- Eye contact: [Direct to camera / slight off-camera]
- Gestures: [Minimal / expressive]
```

### Step 2: Presenter Selection
Define the presenter profile:
- Age range and appearance
- Wardrobe style (casual, business casual, professional)
- Setting/background (home office, studio, outdoor, minimal)
- Energy level (calm authority vs. enthusiastic advocate)

### Step 3: Generate the Video
Using AI video generation tools:
- Input the script with timing markers
- Select or generate the presenter
- Set background and lighting
- Generate lip-sync
- Add captions/subtitles (essential for social)

### Step 4: Post-Production
- Add captions (large, readable, branded colors)
- Add b-roll or product shots if needed
- Include end card with CTA
- Brand elements (logo watermark, lower third)
- Music (subtle, doesn't compete with speech)

### Step 5: Generate Variants
- **Hook variants:** 3 different opening lines
- **Length variants:** 30s, 60s, 90s cuts
- **Platform variants:** 9:16 (Reels/TikTok), 16:9 (YouTube), 1:1 (Feed)

## Ethics Note
When using AI-generated presenters:
- Do NOT present AI-generated people as real customers giving testimonials
- Use for educational/explainer content, or clearly label as AI-generated
- If using for ads, follow platform disclosure requirements
- When representing real testimonials, use actual customer quotes and get permission
