# Skill: AI Product Video

## Purpose
Create product-focused motion content for ads and social media. Produce video assets at scale — product reveals, motion graphics, demo-style content — without traditional video production.

## When This Activates
When creating video ads, social video content, or product reveal animations. Requires a creative brief from the AI Creative Strategist skill.

## Inputs Required
- Creative brief (from AI Creative Strategist)
- Product imagery (from AI Product Photo or existing assets)
- Script or key messaging points
- Brand guidelines (fonts, colors, logo)
- Platform specs and duration requirements

## Video Types

### Product Reveal
**Purpose:** Introduce a product with visual impact.
**Duration:** 15-30 seconds
**Structure:** Teaser → Reveal → Features → CTA
**Best for:** Launch campaigns, awareness ads

### Feature Highlight
**Purpose:** Demonstrate a specific feature or benefit.
**Duration:** 15-30 seconds
**Structure:** Problem → Feature in action → Result
**Best for:** Mid-funnel ads, retargeting

### Testimonial/UGC Style
**Purpose:** Social proof through video (see also AI Talking Head skill).
**Duration:** 30-60 seconds
**Structure:** Person + problem → Discovery → Result → Recommendation
**Best for:** Social media, conversion ads

### Motion Graphic / Explainer
**Purpose:** Explain a concept, process, or value proposition.
**Duration:** 30-90 seconds
**Structure:** Hook → Problem → Solution → How it works → CTA
**Best for:** Complex products, SaaS, services

### Programmatic Ad (Remotion-based)
**Purpose:** Templated video ads generated at scale with variable content.
**Duration:** 15-30 seconds
**Structure:** Template with swappable text, images, CTAs
**Best for:** A/B testing, personalized ads, scaling creative

## Process

### Step 1: Script the Video
For each video asset:
```markdown
## Video Script: [Name]

**Duration:** [X seconds]
**Aspect Ratio:** [16:9 / 9:16 / 1:1]

| Time | Visual | Audio/Text | Notes |
|------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 0-3s | [Hook visual] | [Hook text/voiceover] | Must stop the scroll |
| 3-8s | [Problem visual] | [Problem statement] | |
| 8-15s | [Product in action] | [Key benefit] | |
| 15-25s | [Result/proof] | [Social proof or data] | |
| 25-30s | [CTA screen] | [Clear CTA + URL] | Logo visible |
```

### Step 2: Visual Direction
For each scene:
- Camera movement (zoom, pan, static, tracking)
- Transition style (cut, fade, morph, slide)
- Color grading / mood
- Text animation style (typewriter, fade, bold pop)
- Music/sound direction (upbeat, minimal, cinematic)

### Step 3: Generate Variants
Create 3-5 variants per concept:
- **Hook variants:** Different opening 3 seconds
- **CTA variants:** Different end cards
- **Length variants:** 15s, 30s, 60s cuts from same content
- **Platform variants:** 16:9 (YouTube), 9:16 (Reels/TikTok), 1:1 (Feed)

### Step 4: Production
Select the appropriate tool:
- **Remotion:** For programmatic, template-based video generation
- **Glif MCP:** For AI-generated motion content
- **Manual editing specs:** For handoff to video editing tools

### Step 5: Review
- [ ] First 3 seconds hook attention (no slow intros)
- [ ] Key message is clear with sound off (subtitles/text overlays)
- [ ] CTA is visible and specific
- [ ] Brand elements (logo, colors, fonts) are present
- [ ] Duration matches platform requirements

## Platform Specs Quick Reference
| Platform | Aspect Ratio | Max Duration | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Instagram Reels | 9:16 | 90s | Hook in first 1-2s |
| TikTok | 9:16 | 60s (sweet spot: 15-30s) | Native-feeling, not polished |
| YouTube Shorts | 9:16 | 60s | Title card helpful |
| YouTube Ad | 16:9 | 15s or 30s | Skip button at 5s |
| Facebook/Instagram Feed | 1:1 or 4:5 | 60s | Autoplay, sound off |
| LinkedIn | 16:9 or 1:1 | 30-90s | Professional tone |

## Quality Gates
- [ ] Script follows the hook → problem → solution → CTA arc
- [ ] First 3 seconds are scroll-stopping
- [ ] Watchable with sound off (text overlays / captions)
- [ ] 3-5 variants generated for testing
- [ ] Platform specs met for target distribution
